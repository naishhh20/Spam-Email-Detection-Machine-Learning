# Spam Email Detection Using Machine Learning

This project implements a spam email classification system using machine learning techniques. It utilizes models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a Stacking Ensemble to detect spam emails based on their content.

## Features:
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans and normalizes raw email text.
- **TF-IDF Feature Extraction**: Converts email content into numerical features.
- **Classification Models**: Implements Logistic Regression, SVM, and Stacking Ensemble.
- **Evaluation**: Performance metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

## Installation:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Spam-Email-Detection-Machine-Learning.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the spam detection model:
    ```bash
    python spam_detection.py
    ```

## Dataset:
The model is trained using the 190K Spam-Ham Email Dataset from Kaggle, containing labeled emails for training and evaluation.

## Evaluation Metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Overall prediction correctness.
- **Precision**: How accurate the model's positive predictions are.
- **Recall**: Ability to capture actual spam emails.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.

## Conclusion:
This system demonstrates an effective way to detect spam emails using machine learning, with a focus on model performance through stacking ensemble techniques.
